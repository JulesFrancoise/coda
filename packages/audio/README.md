### Credits

@coda/audio has been developed at [LIMSI-CNRS](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) by [Jules Fran√ßoise](https://www.julesfrancoise.com), and is released under the MIT Licence.

@coda/audio would not exist without the tremendous work of other open-source contributors. @coda/audio relies on several existing libraries:
- [Most](https://github.com/mostjs/core): Monadic Event Stream
- [Waves-Audio](https://github.com/wavesjs/waves-audio): Ircam's Low Frequency Operators
