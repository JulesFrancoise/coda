Coda has been developed at [LIMSI-CNRS](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) by [Jules Fran√ßoise](https://www.julesfrancoise.com), and is released under the MIT Licence.

Coda would not exist without the tremendous work of other open-source contributors. Coda relies on several existing libraries:
- [Most](https://github.com/mostjs/core): Monadic Event Stream
- [Waves-LFO](https://github.com/wavesjs/waves-lfo): Ircam's Low Frequency Operators
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org): The Progressive
JavaScript Framework
- [Tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal): A functional music theory library for Javascript
- [complex-js](https://github.com/patrickroberts/complex-js): JavaScript Complex Math
- [myo.js](https://github.com/thalmiclabs/myo.js): Myo javascript bindings
