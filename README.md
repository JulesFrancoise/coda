**coda.js** is a Javascript library and live-coding environment for designing movement-based interactions in the browser.

**coda.js** integrates a number of modules for movement sensing (with wrappers for common devices such as the Myo Armband or the Leap Motion), movement signal processing (from low-level analysis blocks and filters to more advanced representations such as the wavelet transform), mapping tools (from direct mapping to machine learning-based recognition and regression), as well as some sound synthesis and effect engines.

### Features

- **Fully Reactive**
  coda.js relies on the most.js reactive programming library, allowing for easy asynchronous data stream processing.
- **Compact Syntax**
  coda.js was designed with a compact syntax allowing for extremely rapid prototyping of movement-based interactions.
**Multiple Devices**
  coda.js integrates binding to several commercial sensing devices such as the Myo armband or the Leap Motion, and easily communicates with Cycling'74 Max 8
- **Low-level Signal Processing**
- **Movement Data Visualisation**
- **Interactive Machine Learning**
- **Sound Synthesis**

### Why coda.js ?

The coda.js library emerged in the context of the CO/DA research project at [LIMSI-CNRS](https://www.limsi.fr), that focuses on live-coding as a practice for improvisation in interactive dance. The project aims develop a set of tools for prototyping movement-based interactions on the fly, while a dancer is improvising.

### Credits

CO/DA has been developed at [LIMSI-CNRS](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) by [Jules Françoise](https://www.julesfrancoise.com), and is released under the MIT Licence. The CO/DA project is funded by Réseau Francilien en Sciences Informatiques ([DIM RFSI](https://dim-rfsi.fr/)) of the French Ile-de-France region (2018).
