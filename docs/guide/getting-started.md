# Getting Started

Coda is a JavaScript library build upon a reactive programming paradigm for movement signal processing and interaction design.

If you are not familiar with Web development and JavaScript, check out [JavaScript in 14 minutes](https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/) by Jeremy Thomas for a very brief introduction. Other interesting (and more complete) ressources include:

- The web development course of the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript),
- The [Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/variables),
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/),
- The [FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Using the live-coding editor

The easiest way to get started with `coda.js` is to play around the live-coding environment. Nothing needs to be installed, you just need a **recent** browser (**Chrome** or **Firefox** are recommended). A hosted version of the playground is available online: [https://playcoda.netlify.app](https://playcoda.netlify.app).

::: tip
The playground allows to interpret statements interactively. There are two shortcuts to know:

- `ALT+ENTER` executes the entire block where the pointer is situated
- `CTRL+ENTER` executes the current selection (or the current line only, if no text is selected).
  :::

::: warning
Note that the hosted version has limitations regarding the use of movement sensors, that usually require that you run the environment on your own computer.
