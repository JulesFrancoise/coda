# What is coda.js?

**coda.js** is a javascript library and live-coding environment dedicated to the design of bodily interactions with audio and visual processing.

## Why coda?

The coda.js library emerged in the context of the CO/DA research project at [LIMSI-CNRS](https://www.limsi.fr/fr/), that focuses on live-coding as a practice for improvisation in interactive dance. The goal was to develop a set of tools for prototyping body-based interactions on the fly, while a dancer is improvising.

To that end, we developed a number of libraries supporting rapid design of interactions based on real-time movement information. coda.js integrates a number of modules for movement sensing (with wrappers for common devices such as the Myo Armband), movement signal processing (from low-level analysis blocks and filters to more advanced representations such as the wavelet transform), mapping tools (both for direct mapping and techniques using machine learning for recognition and regression), as well as some sound synthesis and effect engines.

## Features

- **Reactive**<br>`coda.js` relies on the [`most.js`](https://github.com/mostjs/core) reactive programming library, allowing for easy asynchronous data stream processing.
- **Compact Syntax**<br>`coda.js` was designed with a compact syntax allowing for rapid prototyping of movement-based interactions.
- **Multiple Devices**<br>`coda.js` integrates binding to several commercial sensing devices such as the [Myo armband](https://www.myo.com/), and easily communicates with [Cycling'74 Max 8](https://cycling74.com/)
- **Low-level Signal Processing**
- **Movement Data Visualisation**
- **Interactive Machine Learning**
- **Sound Synthesis**

## Overview

Coda is composed of a core library that extends the [`most.js`](https://github.com/mostjs/core) reactive programming library with low-level signal processing operators. The library also includes several optional packages and a live-coding environment.
