Coda would not exist without the tremendous work of other open-source contributors. Coda relies on several existing libraries:
- [Most](https://github.com/mostjs/core): Monadic Event Stream
- [Waves-JS](https://github.com/wavesjs): Ircam's JS signal processing and sound synthesis tools.
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org): The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [Tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal): A functional music theory library for Javascript
- [complex-js](https://github.com/patrickroberts/complex-js): JavaScript Complex Math
- [myo.js](https://github.com/thalmiclabs/myo.js): Myo javascript bindings
